## Shared Project Guidance (CLAUDE.md)

`CLAUDE.md` is the shared source of truth for this repository's engineering rules. Read it completely before making or reviewing changes, and follow it as if its contents appeared here. The filename reflects the project's history; the instructions apply equally to this tool.

- Project workflows are exposed as skills under `.gemini/skills/`. Use a skill when the user names it or the request clearly matches its description.
- The skill adapters delegate to `.claude/skills/`, the canonical source for workflows shared across AI tools. When changing a shared workflow, edit the canonical file and keep the adapter metadata in sync.
- Claude tool names in shared documents describe capabilities, not required product-specific tools — use this tool's equivalent file-search, shell, editing, or web capability.
- Keep durable repository guidance in `CLAUDE.md`; provider-specific configuration belongs in its provider's directory.
